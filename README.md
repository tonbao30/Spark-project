# Spark-project
## Description
This is a case study where we designed the database in the concept of HDFS. We tried to simulate different features of Spark based on Haddoop through the Proofs of Concept

## Proof of concept 1 (POC1)
The folder POC1 provides k-mean clustering algorithm for streaming data using Spark MLlib. When data arrives in a stream, it estimates clusters dynamically, then update them as new example.

## Proof of concept 2 (POC2)
The forlder POC2 provides graph processing algorithm with Spark API. The data input can be found in file test.csv.bz2
